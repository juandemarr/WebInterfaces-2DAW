            <h2>Where does Halloween come from?</h2>
            <p>Halloween originally comes from the Celts that lived in Europe over 2000 years ago. The Celtic festival 
                of Samhain, which comes from the Old Irish for “summer’s end” marked the end of the harvest season and 
                the beginning of winter or the ‘darker half’ of the year. It was seen as a time when the spirits could
                more easily come into our world. The souls of the dead throughout history were both honored and 
                warded-off. The custom of wearing costumes and masks at Halloween goes back to Celtic traditions of 
                attempting to copy the evil spirits or placate them. Bonfires, which were deemed to have protective and
                cleansing powers, were used in rituals and to scare off witches.
