        <p>Media object is a common term given to a UI component where there's an image on one side and text on the other. The image could be on the left or right — it doesn't matter. Usually the text doesn't wrap around the image — it stays on its own side and the image stays on its own side.
            Actually, it doesn't necessarily need to be an image and text. It could be a video/text combination, an image/form combo, or even an image/image combo, etc.</p>
